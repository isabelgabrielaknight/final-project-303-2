Investors in the film industry and studio executives will be interested in our analysis for the same reasons as filmmakers.

For example, the genre of true crime has boomed in the last few years; if someone has a story relating to true crime, whether they are a victim who wants to tell a story or have written a fictional story, they can use this relationship to their advantage and have their movie be more popular/more fruitful now than it would have been in the past.
